Starting over at the local library tutorial. I'm not sure exactly where I went wrong..... I know it was in connecting to the database. 
But upon reading the instructions again I realized I missed the step of changing all the "var's" into const. So fuckit we restart.

Server tested, initiate with:
npm run devstart
formerly: 
DEBUG=express-locallibrary-tutorial:* npm start
